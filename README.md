## Description

This expert advisor is designed to trade the LINKETH trading pair using a combination of moving averages (MA) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator. It follows a simple trading strategy:

1. On each tick, it calculates the fast moving average (fastMa), slow moving average (slowMa), and the RSI (rsi) using the provided input parameters.

2. If the fastMa is greater than the slowMa and the rsi is below the specified threshold (rsiThreshold), a buy signal is generated.

3. If the fastMa is less than the slowMa and the rsi is above the complement of the threshold (100 - rsiThreshold), a sell signal is generated.

4. When a buy or sell signal is generated, the expert advisor places an order with a stop loss percentage defined in the input parameters.

5. At the end of the trading session, the expert advisor calculates the profit/loss, overall profitability, and trade success rate and generates a report.
